## This project is a prototype created for the purpose of an Overseas Social Innovation Project (OSIP)

It is part of the project conducted during the Learning Express in 2019.

This project was conducted over a span of 2 weeks in Banting, Selangor, Malaysia. Singapore Polytechnic partnered with the Polytecnic Banting as part of the school module called the Overseas Social Innovation Project (OSIP). 

The team's aim is to improve the tourism in Rok Fa, a rural part of Isan, Thailand. On top of that, we also find ways to promote its nearby attractions and businesses.

We applied the Design Thinking (DT) tools which we learned from our workshop to our project as well as getting insights during the homestay phrase to come up with a solution.
